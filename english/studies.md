## Halloped

Finnish law dictates that university administration must include student representees. These administrator student representees are called Hallopeds. They are ordinary students who partake in university committees such as Academic committee, Study committee and many other groups in university administration. 

These committees work on, what courses are included in your studies, they accept the theses, fill administrative roles and decide on funding. Study committees also officially grant you the titles of bachelors or master. There are additional committees, which work on the quality of studies/courses and internationalization of university.

You can find the list of Guild's hallopeds below.
