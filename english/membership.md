Full guild membership can be admitted to any member of AYY. As a member of the guild you get: vote in guildmeetings, the right to join in guild events and to use the guildroom and access to the guild's mailinglists. You can get the membership by following the guide below.

## New student

New students of Automation and Robotics, Information Techonolfy and Digital Systems and Design buy the membership the same way as new full members (by following the link at the bottom of the page).

## New full member

You can apply for full guild membership by buying the membership behind the link at the bottom of the page

## Membership renewal

If you are already a member of the guild and want to renew your membership, just buy the membership for the next year from the same link. There is no last day to buy the membership, but it is only valid through the school year (not one year from purchase).

## Old member

Guild's old membership can be applied by a person, who has been a full guild member but is no longer member of AYY. You can apply for old membership by choosing Alumni Membership at the link below. Old members do not have to pay the guild fee.

## Associate membership

Guild's associate membership can be applied by a person, who's interested in the guild's functions, but can not be accepted as a full or old member. Associate membership can be applied by the same methods as full membership and the membership fee is the same.
