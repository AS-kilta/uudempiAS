Committees and Officials are the guildâ€™s labor force, they organize events and/or otherwise keep the guild going. **These committees selflessly use their spare time to have fun, get lifelong friends, developing new skills, while making sure others have a good time. Joining committees is as easy as talking with the committee leader!**
