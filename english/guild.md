## Guild
The Guild of Automation and Systems Technology is the guild for students majoring in Automation and Control Engineering or Information Technology at Aalto University. It arranges different kinds of events for its members and develops individuals to have a strong skillset as professionals and identity as students of technology. AS also aims to represent its members in the universityâ€™s administration and encourages them to follow their professional and social interests.

## ASki
Our guildroom ASki [is located in TUAS-building's first floor]({{ "kilta/askikartta.html" | absolute_url }}), at the end of a corridor behind the library. ASki's name ('matchbox') come from the early days of the guild, when the guildroom was a tiny room in the T-building. In 2003 when TUAS-building was opened, ASki moved in where it currently is. The grand opening was held on the anniversary week November 17th 2003 and nowadays ASki's birthday is celebrated around that date.

ASki is the livingroom of the guild members, where one can spend time between lectures by, for example, playing board- and videogames and reading magazines. There have also been sightings of somebody actually studying there. ASki's small kiosk serves the guild member and you can get, in addition to coffee and tea, snacks for smaller or larger hunger from there.

The committee of ASki, Guardians of ASki lead by the Master of ASki, is in charge of usage, filling of the cabinets and overall order of ASki. If you have any development ideas or problems involving ASki, the committee is the right place to contact. Contact informations can be find under [Committees page]({{ "english/committees.html" | absolute_url }})

ASki also contains the guilds storage room, from which the board and the members of the Committee of ASki can sell guild's overall badges, songbook and other items.
