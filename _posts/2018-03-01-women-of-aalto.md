*Women of Aalto & Teekkaritytöt unite - Join our growing network*
 
The winds of change are blowing and it’s time to welcome the new exciting times for Women of Aalto and Teekkaritytöt with our first Kick Off & Annual General Meeting together on March 8th, the International Women’s Day!

This spring and following year we want to emphasize diversity - how it benefits us all and how to actually work with diversified group of people efficiently. What better way to start this than unifying our powers with Women of Aalto and Teekkaritytöt. Together we have the honour of hearing what our guest speaker from Accenture has learned of the topic.

After Accenture’s presentation we have time for open discussion and free mingling before the annual general meeting. This is your place and time to really get to know Women of Aalto and Accenture. Don’t miss this opportunity to connect with your future colleagues! We are looking for new board members that are willing to keep developing women’s network in the Aalto society. If you are interested, we are more than happy to tell you more about Women of Aalto!

On top of all to make the event even more enjoyable, we are happy to offer you drinks and snacks! For more information, check out the event's Facebook page: <https://www.facebook.com/events/744240275775830/>
