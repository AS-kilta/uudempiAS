Well, now is your chance because we at Asia Exchange are thrilled to introduce our brand new and long-awaited study abroad destination, [Shih Chien University](https://www.asiaexchange.org/study-destinations/taipei-taiwan/shih-chien-university/?utm_source=sendy&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=call_Taiwan2018) in [Taipei Taiwan](https://www.asiaexchange.org/study-destinations/taipei-taiwan/?utm_source=sendy&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=call_Taiwan2018)!

In recent years, Taiwan has become a sought-after destination among international students and expats and you don’t have to look far to see why. As one of the four Asian Tigers, Taiwan is one of the most important technological and economic centers of East Asia offering great job prospects for anyone aiming for a career in international business or technology. Compared to many other Asian nations, the living standards and the quality of education in Taiwan are considerably high. Taiwan is also ranked as the 2nd safest country in the whole world, surpassing even countries like Germany, Finland and Sweden. The Taiwanese are also among the most liberal nations in Asia thanks to their successful efforts in advancing minority and human rights and gender equality.

Despite its modern and Western-like atmosphere, Taiwan still has a rich and complex cultural heritage that is strongly influenced especially by the Chinese along with the Japanese, the Spanish, the Dutch and the indigenous cultures. The ancient traditions and values blend in seamlessly in the modern, developed society. 

Taiwan also has an exceptionally diverse landscape and nature ranging from majestic mountains and national parks to beautiful beaches and hot springs. Environmental issues receive also a lot of attention in Taiwan. In Taipei alone, there are thousands of beautiful and safe bike routes providing you an easy and environmentally-friendly way to explore the city.
